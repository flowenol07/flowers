      "<blockquote>\n<p>As there is a superconscient (something above our present consciousness) above the head from which the higher consciousness comes down into the body, so there is also a subconscient (something below our consciousness) below the feet. Matter is under the control of this power, because it is that out of which it has been created—that is why matter seems to us to be quite unconscious. The material body is very much under the influence of this power for the same reason; it is why we are not conscious of what is going on in the body, for the most part. The outer consciousness goes down into this subconscient when we are asleep, and so it becomes unaware of what is going on in us when we are asleep except for a few dreams. Many of these dreams rise up from the subconscient and are made up of old memories, impressions etc. put together in an incoherent way.

There dwells the little spark of the Divine which supports the obscure mass of our nature and around it grows the psychic being, the formed soul or the real Man within us. It is as this psychic being in him grows and the movements of the heart reflect its divinations and impulsions that man becomes more and more aware of his soul, ceases to be a superior animal and, awakening to glimpses of the godhead within him, admits more and more its intimations of a deeper life and consciousness and an impulse towards things divine. It is one of the decisive moments of the integral Yoga when this psychic being, liberated, brought out from the veil to the front, can pour the full flood of its divinations, seeings and impulsions on the mind, life and body of man and begins to prepare the upbuilding of divinity in the earthly nature.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/23\/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-i#p17\"><em>The Synthesis of Yoga - I: The Ascent of the Sacrifice - I<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",

Yet the soul is at first but a spark and then a little flame of godhead burning in the midst of a great darkness… It is only when the life turns towards the Divine that the soul can truly come forward and impose its power on the outer members; for, itself a spark of the Divine, to grow in flame towards the Divine is its true life and its very reason of existence.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/23\/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-i#p21\"><em>The Synthesis of Yoga - I: The Ascent of the Sacrifice - I<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",

Even within the obscure workings of the Ignorance we have then a witness who discerns, a living light that illumines, a will that refuses to be misled and separates the mind&#39;s truth from its error, the heart&#39;s intimate response from its vibrations to a wrong call and wrong demand upon it, the life&#39;s true ardour and plenitude of movement from vital passion and the turbid falsehoods of our vital nature and its dark self seekings. This is the first step of self-realisation, to enthrone the soul, the divine psychic individual in the place of the ego.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/21\/the-origin-and-remedy-of-falsehood-error-wrong-and-evil#p35\"><em>The Life Divine - I: The Origin and Remedy of Falsehood, Error, Wrong and Evil<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n<p>In order to strengthen the [conscious contact with one&#39;s psychic being] and aid, if possible, the development of the conscious psychic personality, one should, while concentrating, turn towards it, aspire to know it and feel it, open oneself to receive its influence, and take great care, each time that one receives an indication from it, to follow it very scrupulously and sincerely. To live in a great aspiration, to take care to become inwardly calm and remain so always as far as possible, to cultivate a perfect sincerity in all the activities of one&#39;s being—these are the essential conditions for the growth of the psychic being.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>The Mother, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwm\/16\/10-september-1959#p5\"><em>Some Answers from the Mother: 10 September 1959<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n"

          "<blockquote>\n<p>There comes a time when one begins to be almost ready, when one can feel in everything, every object, in every movement, in every vibration, in all the things around—not only people and conscious beings, but things, objects; not only trees and plants and living things, but simply any object one uses, the things around one—this delight, this delight of being, of being just as one is, simply being. And one sees that all this vibrates like that. One touches a thing and feels this delight…\nThis delight is something very subtle. One moves in the midst of things and it is as though they were all singing to you their delight. There comes a time when it becomes very familiar in the life around you… In plants, in flowers, it is so wonderful! They speak all their joy, they express it. And as I said, in all familiar objects, the things around you, which you use, there is a state of consciousness in which each one is happy to be, just as it is. So at that moment one knows one has touched true Delight. And it is not conditioned. I mean it does not depend upon… it depends on nothing. It does not depend on outer circumstances, does not depend on a more or less favourable state, it does not depend on anything: it is a communion with the <em>raison d&#39;&ecirc;tre<\/em> of the universe.\nAnd when this comes it fills all the cells of the body. It is not even a thing which is thought out—one does no reason, does not analyse, it is not that: it is a state in which one lives. And when the body shares in it, it is so fresh—so fresh, so spontaneous, so… it no longer turns back upon itself, there is no longer any sense of self-observation, of self-analysis or of analysing things. All that is like a canticle of joyous vibrations, but very, very quiet, without violence, without passion, nothing of all that. It is very subtle and very intense at the same time, and when it comes, it seems that the whole universe is a marvellous harmony.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>The Mother, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwm\/09\/23-january-1957#p18\"><em>Questions and Answers 1957 - 1958: 23 January 1957<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n"

I ask nothing but that and his action in me to bring me to him, his action secret or open, veiled or manifest. I do not insist on my own time and way; let him do all in his own time and way, I shall believe in him, accept his will, aspire steadily for his light and presence and joy, go through all difficulties and delays relying on him and never giving up. Let my mind be quiet and turn to him and let him open it to his light; let my vital be quiet and turn to him alone and let him open it to his calm and joy. All for him and myself for him.

And then you say, &quot;See, what&#39;s the use of aspiring? It brings nothing at all. I meet with something hard and cannot pass!&quot; But you know about the drop of water which falls on the rock, it ends up by making a chasm: it cuts the rock from top to bottom. Your aspiration is a drop of water which, instead of falling, rises. So, by dint of rising, it beats, beats, beats, and one day it makes a hole, by dint of rising; and when it makes the hole suddenly it springs out from this lid and enters an immensity of light, and you say, &quot;Ah, now I understand.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p><small>The Mother, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwm\/07\/13-july-1955#p25\"><em>Questions and Answers 1955: 13 July 1955<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n"

      "<blockquote>\n<p>The true soul of man is in the true invisible heart hidden in some luminous cave of the nature: there under some infiltration of the divine Light is our soul, a silent inmost being of which few are even aware; for if all have a soul, few are conscious of their true soul or feel its direct impulse. There dwells the little spark of the Divine which supports the obscure mass of our nature and around it grows the psychic being, the formed soul or the real Man within us. It is as this psychic being in him grows and the movements of the heart reflect its divinations and impulsions that man becomes more and more aware of his soul, ceases to be a superior animal and, awakening to glimpses of the godhead within him, admits more and more its intimations of a deeper life and consciousness and an impulse towards things divine. It is one of the decisive moments of the integral Yoga when this psychic being, liberated, brought out from the veil to the front, can pour the full flood of its divinations, seeings and impulsions on the mind, life and body of man and begins to prepare the upbuilding of divinity in the earthly nature.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/23\/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-i#p17\"><em>The Synthesis of Yoga - I: The Ascent of the Sacrifice - I<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n<p>It is the very nature of the soul or the psychic being to turn towards the divine Truth as the sunflower to the sun; it accepts and clings to all that is divine or progressing towards divinity, and draws back from all that is a perversion or a denial of it, from all that is false and undivine. Yet the soul is at first but a spark and then a little flame of godhead burning in the midst of a great darkness… It is only when the life turns towards the Divine that the soul can truly come forward and impose its power on the outer members; for, itself a spark of the Divine, to grow in flame towards the Divine is its true life and its very reason of existence.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/23\/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-i#p21\"><em>The Synthesis of Yoga - I: The Ascent of the Sacrifice - I<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n<p>The first [step of self-realisation] is the discovery of the soul, not the outer soul of thought and emotion and desire, but the secret psychic entity, the divine element within us. When that becomes dominant over the nature, when we are consciously the soul and when mind, life and body take their true place as its instruments, we are aware of a guide within that knows the truth, the good, the true delight and beauty of existence, controls heart and intellect by its luminous law and leads our life and being towards spiritual completeness. Even within the obscure workings of the Ignorance we have then a witness who discerns, a living light that illumines, a will that refuses to be misled and separates the mind&#39;s truth from its error, the heart&#39;s intimate response from its vibrations to a wrong call and wrong demand upon it, the life&#39;s true ardour and plenitude of movement from vital passion and the turbid falsehoods of our vital nature and its dark self seekings.

      "<blockquote>\n<p>By surrender we mean not this but a spontaneous self-giving, a giving of all your self to the Divine, to a greater Consciousness of which you are a part. Surrender will not diminish, but increase; it will not lessen or weaken or destroy your personality, it will fortify and aggrandise it. Surrender means a free total giving with all the delight of the giving… True surrender enlarges you; it increases your capacity; it gives you a greater measure in quality and in quantity which you could not have had by yourself. This new greater measure of quality and quantity is different from anything you could attain before: you enter into another world, into a wideness which you could not have entered if you did not surrender. It is as when a drop of water falls into the sea; if it still kept there its separate identity, it would remain a little drop of water and nothing more, a little drop crushed by all the immensity around, because it has not surrendered. But, surrendering, it unites with the sea and participates in the nature and power and vastness of the whole sea.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>The Mother, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwm\/03\/4-august-1929#p3\"><em>Questions and Answers 1929 - 1931: 4 August 1929<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n<p>Surrender is the decision taken to hand over the responsibility of your life to the Divine. Without this decision nothing is at all possible; if you do not surrender, the Yoga is entirely out of the question. Everything else comes naturally after it, for the whole process starts with surrender. You can surrender either through knowledge or through devotion. You may have a strong intuition that the Divine alone is the truth and a luminous conviction that without the Divine you cannot manage. Or you may have a spontaneous feeling that this line is the only way of being happy, a strong psychic desire to belong exclusively to the Divine: &quot;I do not belong to myself,&quot; you say, and give up the responsibility of your being to the Truth. Then comes self-offering: &quot;Here I am, a creature of various qualities, good and bad, dark and enlightened.

      "<blockquote>\n<p>As there is a superconscient (something above our present consciousness) above the head from which the higher consciousness comes down into the body, so there is also a subconscient (something below our consciousness) below the feet. Matter is under the control of this power, because it is that out of which it has been created—that is why matter seems to us to be quite unconscious. The material body is very much under the influence of this power for the same reason; it is why we are not conscious of what is going on in the body, for the most part. The outer consciousness goes down into this subconscient when we are asleep, and so it becomes unaware of what is going on in us when we are asleep except for a few dreams. Many of these dreams rise up from the subconscient and are made up of old memories, impressions etc. put together in an incoherent way. For the subconscient receives impressions of all we do or experience in our lives and keeps these impressions in it, sending up often fragments of them in sleep. It is a very important part of the being, but we can do nothing much with it by the conscious will. It is the higher Force working in us that in its natural course will open the subconscient to itself and bring down into it its control and light.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/31\/the-subconscient-and-the-integral-yoga#p19\"><em>Letters on Yoga - IV: The Subconscient and the Integral Yoga<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",

When that becomes dominant over the nature, when we are consciously the soul and when mind, life and body take their true place as its instruments, we are aware of a guide within that knows the truth, the good, the true delight and beauty of existence, controls heart and intellect by its luminous law and leads our life and being towards spiritual completeness. Even within the obscure workings of the Ignorance we have then a witness who discerns, a living light that illumines, a will that refuses to be misled and separates the mind&#39;s truth from its error, the heart&#39;s intimate response from its vibrations to a wrong call and wrong demand upon it, the life&#39;s true ardour and plenitude of movement from vital passion and the turbid falsehoods of our vital nature and its dark self seekings. This is the first step of self-realisation, to enthrone the soul, the divine psychic individual in the place of the ego.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/21\/the-origin-and-remedy-of-falsehood-error-wrong-and-evil#p35\"><em>The Life Divine - I: The Origin and Remedy of Falsehood, Error, Wrong and Evil<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",

      "<blockquote>\n<p>As there is a superconscient (something above our present consciousness) above the head from which the higher consciousness comes down into the body, so there is also a subconscient (something below our consciousness) below the feet. Matter is under the control of this power, because it is that out of which it has been created—that is why matter seems to us to be quite unconscious. The material body is very much under the influence of this power for the same reason; it is why we are not conscious of what is going on in the body, for the most part. The outer consciousness goes down into this subconscient when we are asleep, and so it becomes unaware of what is going on in us when we are asleep except for a few dreams. Many of these dreams rise up from the subconscient and are made up of old memories, impressions etc. put together in an incoherent way. For the subconscient receives impressions of all we do or experience in our lives and keeps these impressions in it, sending up often fragments of them in sleep. It is a very important part of the being, but we can do nothing much with it by the conscious will. It is the higher Force working in us that in its natural course will open the subconscient to itself and bring down into it its control and light.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/31\/the-subconscient-and-the-integral-yoga#p19\"><em>Letters on Yoga - IV: The Subconscient and the Integral Yoga<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",

      "<blockquote>\n<p>Yoga means union with the Divine, and the union is effected through offering—it is founded on the offering of yourself to the Divine. In the beginning you start by making this offering in a general way, as though once for all; you say, &quot;I am the servant of the Divine; my life is given absolutely to the Divine; all my efforts are for the realisation of the Divine Life.&quot; But that is only the first step; for this is not sufficient. When the resolution has been taken, when you have decided that the whole of your life shall be given to the Divine, you have still at every moment to remember it and carry it out in all the details of your existence. You must feel at every step that you belong to the Divine; you must have the constant experience that, in whatever you think or do, it is always the Divine Consciousness that is acting through you. You have no longer anything that you can call your own; you feel everything as coming from the Divine, and you have to offer it back to its source. When you can realise that, then even the smallest thing to which you do not usually pay much attention or care, ceases to be trivial and insignificant; it becomes full of meaning and it opens up a vast horizon beyond.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>The Mother, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwm\/03\/28-april-1929#p2\"><em>Questions and Answers 1929 - 1931: 28 April 1929<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n"

      "<blockquote>\n<p>The true soul of man is in the true invisible heart hidden in some luminous cave of the nature: there under some infiltration of the divine Light is our soul, a silent inmost being of which few are even aware; for if all have a soul, few are conscious of their true soul or feel its direct impulse. There dwells the little spark of the Divine which supports the obscure mass of our nature and around it grows the psychic being, the formed soul or the real Man within us. It is as this psychic being in him grows and the movements of the heart reflect its divinations and impulsions that man becomes more and more aware of his soul, ceases to be a superior animal and, awakening to glimpses of the godhead within him, admits more and more its intimations of a deeper life and consciousness and an impulse towards things divine. It is one of the decisive moments of the integral Yoga when this psychic being, liberated, brought out from the veil to the front, can pour the full flood of its divinations, seeings and impulsions on the mind, life and body of man and begins to prepare the upbuilding of divinity in the earthly nature.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/23\/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-i#p17\"><em>The Synthesis of Yoga - I: The Ascent of the Sacrifice - I<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",

Yet the soul is at first but a spark and then a little flame of godhead burning in the midst of a great darkness… It is only when the life turns towards the Divine that the soul can truly come forward and impose its power on the outer members; for, itself a spark of the Divine, to grow in flame towards the Divine is its true life and its very reason of existence.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/23\/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-i#p21\"><em>The Synthesis of Yoga - I: The Ascent of the Sacrifice - I<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",

Even within the obscure workings of the Ignorance we have then a witness who discerns, a living light that illumines, a will that refuses to be misled and separates the mind&#39;s truth from its error, the heart&#39;s intimate response from its vibrations to a wrong call and wrong demand upon it, the life&#39;s true ardour and plenitude of movement from vital passion and the turbid falsehoods of our vital nature and its dark self seekings.

And then with that aspiration you do this (<em>gesture<\/em>). Your aspiration rises, rises, rises, rises straight up, very strong and then it strikes against a kind of… how to put it?… lid which is there, hard like iron and extremely thick, and it does not pass through. And then you say, &quot;See, what&#39;s the use of aspiring? It brings nothing at all. I meet with something hard and cannot pass!&quot; But you know about the drop of water which falls on the rock, it ends up by making a chasm: it cuts the rock from top to bottom. Your aspiration is a drop of water which, instead of falling, rises. So, by dint of rising, it beats, beats, beats, and one day it makes a hole, by dint of rising; and when it makes the hole suddenly it springs out from this lid and enters an immensity of light, and you say, &quot;Ah, now I understand.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p><small>The Mother, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwm\/07\/13-july-1955#p25\"><em>Questions and Answers 1955: 13 July 1955<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n"

In any case, my speculations about an extreme form of divinisation are something in a far distance and are no part of the preoccupations of the spiritual life in the near future.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/35\/spiritual-force-and-the-body#p3\"><em>Letters on Himself and the Ashram: Spiritual Force and the Body<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n"

The body is a very enduring servant, it bears the stress of circumstance tamely like a beast of burden. It is the vital being that is always grumbling and uneasy. The slavery and torture to which it subjects the physical is almost incalculable. How it twists and deforms the poor body to its own fads and fancies, irrationally demanding that everything should be shaped according to its whimsicality! But the very essence of endurance is that the vital should learn to give up its capricious likes and dislikes and preserve an equanimity in the midst of the most trying conditions.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>The Mother, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwm\/03\/endurance-the-vitals-hunger-for-praise-signs-of-the-converted-vital#p1\"><em>Questions and Answers 1929 - 1931: Endurance - the Vital&#39;s Hunger for Praise - Signs of the Converted Vital<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",

In the same way our aim is to go beyond emotion to the height and depth and intensity of the Divine Love and there feel through the inner psychic heart an inexhaustible oneness with the Divine which the spasmodic leapings of the vital emotions cannot reach or experience.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/29\/divine-love-psychic-love-and-human-love#p39\"><em>Letters on Yoga - II: Divine Love, Psychic Love and Human Love<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",

There dwells the little spark of the Divine which supports the obscure mass of our nature and around it grows the psychic being, the formed soul or the real Man within us. It is as this psychic being in him grows and the movements of the heart reflect its divinations and impulsions that man becomes more and more aware of his soul, ceases to be a superior animal and, awakening to glimpses of the godhead within him, admits more and more its intimations of a deeper life and consciousness and an impulse towards things divine. It is one of the decisive moments of the integral Yoga when this psychic being, liberated, brought out from the veil to the front, can pour the full flood of its divinations, seeings and impulsions on the mind, life and body of man and begins to prepare the upbuilding of divinity in the earthly nature.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/23\/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-i#p17\"><em>The Synthesis of Yoga - I: The Ascent of the Sacrifice - I<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",

Yet the soul is at first but a spark and then a little flame of godhead burning in the midst of a great darkness… It is only when the life turns towards the Divine that the soul can truly come forward and impose its power on the outer members; for, itself a spark of the Divine, to grow in flame towards the Divine is its true life and its very reason of existence.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/23\/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-i#p21\"><em>The Synthesis of Yoga - I: The Ascent of the Sacrifice - I<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",

Even within the obscure workings of the Ignorance we have then a witness who discerns, a living light that illumines, a will that refuses to be misled and separates the mind&#39;s truth from its error, the heart&#39;s intimate response from its vibrations to a wrong call and wrong demand upon it, the life&#39;s true ardour and plenitude of movement from vital passion and the turbid falsehoods of our vital nature and its dark self seekings.

      "<blockquote>\n<p>You must always step back into yourself—learn to go deep within—step back and you will be safe. Do not lend yourself to the superficial forces which move in the outside world. Even if you are in a hurry to do something, step back for a while and you will discover to your surprise how much sooner and with what greater success your work can be done. If someone is angry with you, do not be caught in his vibrations but simply step back and his anger, finding no support or response, will vanish. Always keep your peace, resist all temptation to lose it. Never decide anything without stepping back, never speak a word without stepping back, never throw yourself into action without stepping back. All that belongs to the ordinary world is impermanent and fugitive, so there is nothing in it worth getting upset about. What is lasting, eternal, immortal and infinite—that indeed is worth having, worth conquering, worth possessing. It is Divine Light, Divine Love, Divine Life—it is also Supreme Peace, Perfect Joy and All-Mastery upon earth with the Complete Manifestation as the crowning.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>The Mother, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwm\/03\/stepping-back#p1\"><em>Questions and Answers 1929 - 1931: Stepping Back<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n"

Surrender will not diminish, but increase; it will not lessen or weaken or destroy your personality, it will fortify and aggrandise it. Surrender means a free total giving with all the delight of the giving… True surrender enlarges you; it increases your capacity; it gives you a greater measure in quality and in quantity which you could not have had by yourself. This new greater measure of quality and quantity is different from anything you could attain before: you enter into another world, into a wideness which you could not have entered if you did not surrender. It is as when a drop of water falls into the sea; if it still kept there its separate identity, it would remain a little drop of water and nothing more, a little drop crushed by all the immensity around, because it has not surrendered. But, surrendering, it unites with the sea and participates in the nature and power and vastness of the whole sea.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>The Mother, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwm\/03\/4-august-1929#p3\"><em>Questions and Answers 1929 - 1931: 4 August 1929<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",

      "<blockquote>\n<p>The true soul of man is in the true invisible heart hidden in some luminous cave of the nature: there under some infiltration of the divine Light is our soul, a silent inmost being of which few are even aware; for if all have a soul, few are conscious of their true soul or feel its direct impulse. There dwells the little spark of the Divine which supports the obscure mass of our nature and around it grows the psychic being, the formed soul or the real Man within us. It is as this psychic being in him grows and the movements of the heart reflect its divinations and impulsions that man becomes more and more aware of his soul, ceases to be a superior animal and, awakening to glimpses of the godhead within him, admits more and more its intimations of a deeper life and consciousness and an impulse towards things divine. It is one of the decisive moments of the integral Yoga when this psychic being, liberated, brought out from the veil to the front, can pour the full flood of its divinations, seeings and impulsions on the mind, life and body of man and begins to prepare the upbuilding of divinity in the earthly nature.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/23\/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-i#p17\"><em>The Synthesis of Yoga - I: The Ascent of the Sacrifice - I<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n<p>It is the very nature of the soul or the psychic being to turn towards the divine Truth as the sunflower to the sun; it accepts and clings to all that is divine or progressing towards divinity, and draws back from all that is a perversion or a denial of it, from all that is false and undivine. Yet the soul is at first but a spark and then a little flame of godhead burning in the midst of a great darkness… It is only when the life turns towards the Divine that the soul can truly come forward and impose its power on the outer members; for, itself a spark of the Divine, to grow in flame towards the Divine is its true life and its very reason of existence.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/23\/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-i#p21\"><em>The Synthesis of Yoga - I: The Ascent of the Sacrifice - I<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",

Even within the obscure workings of the Ignorance we have then a witness who discerns, a living light that illumines, a will that refuses to be misled and separates the mind&#39;s truth from its error, the heart&#39;s intimate response from its vibrations to a wrong call and wrong demand upon it, the life&#39;s true ardour and plenitude of movement from vital passion and the turbid falsehoods of our vital nature and its dark self seekings.

Matter is under the control of this power, because it is that out of which it has been created—that is why matter seems to us to be quite unconscious. The material body is very much under the influence of this power for the same reason; it is why we are not conscious of what is going on in the body, for the most part. The outer consciousness goes down into this subconscient when we are asleep, and so it becomes unaware of what is going on in us when we are asleep except for a few dreams. Many of these dreams rise up from the subconscient and are made up of old memories, impressions etc. put together in an incoherent way. For the subconscient receives impressions of all we do or experience in our lives and keeps these impressions in it, sending up often fragments of them in sleep. It is a very important part of the being, but we can do nothing much with it by the conscious will. It is the higher Force working in us that in its natural course will open the subconscient to itself and bring down into it its control and light.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/31\/the-subconscient-and-the-integral-yoga#p19\"><em>Letters on Yoga - IV: The Subconscient and the Integral Yoga<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",

      "<blockquote>\n<p>The insistence on purification [of emotions] does not mean that I condemn true feeling and emotion any more than the insistence on a purified mind or will means that I condemn thought and will. On the contrary, the deeper the emotion, the more intense the Bhakti, the greater is the force for realisation and transformation. It is oftenest through intensity of emotion that the psychic being awakes and there is an opening of the inner doors to the Divine.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/29\/bhakti-devotion-worship#p29\"><em>Letters on Yoga - II: Bhakti, Devotion, Worship<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n<p>Emotion is an excellent and indispensable thing in human nature, in spite of all its shortcomings and dangers… But our aim is to go beyond mental ideas into the light of the supramental Truth, which exists not by ideative thought but by direct vision and identity. In the same way our aim is to go beyond emotion to the height and depth and intensity of the Divine Love and there feel through the inner psychic heart an inexhaustible oneness with the Divine which the spasmodic leapings of the vital emotions cannot reach or experience.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>Sri Aurobindo, <a href=\"http:\/\/incarnateword.in\/cwsa\/29\/divine-love-psychic-love-and-human-love#p39\"><em>Letters on Yoga - II: Divine Love, Psychic Love and Human Love<\/em><\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n",
